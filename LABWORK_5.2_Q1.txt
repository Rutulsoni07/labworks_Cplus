 Q.1 Write a Program to find the minimum number from the given 3 numbers using nested if else. Also, draw a Flowchart in your book.


INPUT=
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int first_number;
    int second_number;
    int third_number;
    
    printf("Enter a value of first number :");
    scanf("%d",&first_number);
    
    printf("Enter a value of second number :");
    scanf("%d",&second_number);
    
    printf("Enter a value of third number :");
    scanf("%d",&third_number);
    
   if (first_number < second_number){
       if (first_number < third_number)
       printf("first number is minimum : %d",first_number);
   }
   else if (third_number< first_number){
       printf("third number is minimum : %d",third_number);
   }

  else if(second_number < third_number){
      printf("second number is minimum : %d",second_number);
  }
  else {
      printf("third number is minimum");  }
  }

return 0;

 


OUTPUT=
Enter a value of first number :8
Enter a value of second number :3
Enter a value of third number :12
the minimum value is : 3
