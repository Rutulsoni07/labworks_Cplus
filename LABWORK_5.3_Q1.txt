Q.1 Write a Program to find the minimum number from the given 3 numbers using the ternary operator.

INPUT:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int first_number, second_number, third_number;
    printf("enter a value of the first number:");
    scanf("%d",&first_number);
    
    printf("enter a value of the second number:");
    scanf("%d",&second_number);
    
    printf("enter a value of the third number :");
    scanf("%d",&third_number);
    
    (first_number < second_number)? (first_number < third_number)? printf("The minium value is: %d", first_number) : printf("the minimum value is : %d",third_number):(second_number > third_number) ? printf("the minimum value is : %d", second_number) : printf("the minimum value is %d", third_number);
    

    return 0;
}

OUTPUT:

enter a value of the first number:8
enter a value of the second number:3
enter a value of the third number :12
the minimum value is 12
